**Abstract**

Determining the diverse cell types in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and their organization into cellular communities, is critical for understanding the biological heterogeneity and therapy of cancer. Here, we deeply immunophenotype the colorectal cancer (CRC) by integrative analysis of large-scale bulk and single cell transcriptome of 2350 patients and 53,137 cells. A rich landscape of 42 cellular states and 7 ecosystems in TMEs are uncovered and extend the previous immune classifications of CRC. Functional pathways and potential transcriptional regulators analysis of cellular states and ecosystems reveal cancer hallmark-related pathways and several critical transcription factors in CRC. High-resolution characterization of the TMEs, we discover the potential utility of cellular states (i.e., Monocytes/Macrophages and CD8 T cell) and ecosystems for prognosis and clinical therapy selection of CRC. Together, our results expand our understanding of cellular organization in TMEs of CRC, with potential implications for the development of biomarkers and precision therapies.
